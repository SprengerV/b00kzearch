<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This is the perfect app for anyone looking to create a reading list.



<!-- TESTING -->
## Testing

Clone the repository and then navigate to the directory it is saved to via the terminal. Run the command 'npm install' to install all necessary dependencies. Create a file named '.env' in the root of the directory and set the env to whatever you'd like. Then create a corresponding file named '.env.<YOUR ENVIRONMENT>' and populate it with the necessary environment variables as outlined in '.env.EXAMPLE'. Run the command 'npm run watch' to start the server. Open another terminal window and cd into the 'client' directory. Run 'npm install' once again. After the dependencies have installed, run 'npm start' to start the development server. The browser should open to the app.
